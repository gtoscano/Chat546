Biography:

Arash Massoudieh joined the Catholic University of America in 2008 where
he currently is a professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental
Engineering. Prior to joining Catholic University, he was a project
scientist at UC Davis for two years. Massoudieh’s research interest is
mainly the interface between software development and Environmental
Engineering. Specifically, Massoudieh has worked on developing software
applications for predicting the effects of sustainable stormwater
management practices on hydrology and water quality of surface water,
inverse modeling, and upscaling reactive transport of contaminants in
subsurface environments.
