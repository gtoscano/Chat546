Biography:

Dr. Zhaoyang Wang holds two doctoral degrees in solid mechanics and
microelectronics reliability, respectively. His group is known for their
work in the fields of solid mechanics and computer vision for 2D/3D
shape, profile, motion, deformation, and vibration measurements at
multi-scales in various circumstances. Dr. Wang’s current research
focuses on experimental mechanics, computer vision, robotics, and
machine learning. In 2009, Dr. Wang demonstrated 3D imaging work at the
Smithsonian National Museum of American History. It was featured or
reported in CBS morning news, Business Week magazine, The Washington
Times, Voice of America news, etc. In 2014, his work on measuring tiny
vibrations with a high-speed camera drew considerable attention from
social media.
