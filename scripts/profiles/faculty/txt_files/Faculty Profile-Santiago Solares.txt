Biography:

Santiago Solares joined The Catholic University of America in 2023,
prior to which he held faculty positions at The George Washington
University (Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, 2014-2023) and at the
University of Maryland, College Park (Mechanical Engineering,
2006-2014). His research program spans scanning probe microscopies,
nanoscale mechanics, surface science, multiscale modeling and
viscoelastic materials, especially polymers and biological materials. He
has published over 100 peer reviewed journal articles and is the
recipient of the NSF and DOE CAREER awards. His teaching interests
include multi-scale simulation methods (atomistic to continuum),
thermodynamics, mechanics and dynamics. Before joining academia, he held
various technical and management positions with Pepsi-Cola International
and Mars Incorporated.
