Research Lab, and NEC Laboratories America. He was an adjunct professor
of WINLAB, the ECE Dept., Rutgers University from 2004 to 2012. Dr. Liu
has published more than 100 papers in leading journals and conferences,
and received two best paper awards and one best student paper award. He
is the inventor/co-inventor of over 50 granted US patents. He has also
made many contributions to the IEEE 802 wireless standards and 3GPP
standards, and was the editor of the IEEE 802.11aa standard and the
rapporteur of a 3GPP work item.
