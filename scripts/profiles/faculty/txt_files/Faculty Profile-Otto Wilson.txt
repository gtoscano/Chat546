Biography:

Dr. Otto C. Wilson, Jr. is an Associate Professor in the Department of
Biomedical Engineering. He earned his BS, MS, and PhD degrees in Ceramic
Science and Engineering from Rutgers University and conducted
Postdoctoral research on machinable dental ceramics and novel synthesis
methods for hydroxyapatite based composites at the University of
Maryland and Johns Hopkins Medical Campus in 1996 and 1997.Otto was
awarded an NSF CAREER Award for his work related to Bone Inspiration in
Research and Education. Otto is passionate about K-12 and
undergraduate/graduate education. He enjoys designing art and reading
enhanced STEM learning modules, curriculum, and dynamic children's
stories to help young scholars learn at their full potential and
explore the wonders of the universe from Quarks to Quasars and
everything in between.
