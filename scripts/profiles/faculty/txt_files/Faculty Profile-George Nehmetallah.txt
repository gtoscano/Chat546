Biography:

Dr. George Nehmetallah is currently Associate Professor in the EECS
department at CUA. From 2011-2012, he was at the University of Dayton
(UD) as a Research Professor. Prior to this, he was a post-Doctoral
Researcher and Research Engineer with UD. He has been funded by NSF,
NASA, Air Force, Army, and DARPA and was one of the 11 out of over 500
that received the Army SBIR Achievement award in 2011. His research
interests are in 3D imaging, computational imaging using machine
learning, interferometry, diffraction tomography, and holographic and
ptychographic microscopy. He has authored a book on Analog and Digital
holography with MATLAB® and published more than 150 refereed journal
papers, review articles and conference proceedings. He is a senior
member of OSA and SPIE.
