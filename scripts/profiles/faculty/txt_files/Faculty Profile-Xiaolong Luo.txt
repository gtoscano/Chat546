Faculty Profile: Xiaolong Luo
Associate Professor

Department: Mechanical Engineering

School: School of Engineering

Email: luox@cua.edu

Phone: 202-319-6952

Education: Ph.D. in Bioengineering, University of Maryland, 2008

Research Interests and Expertise:

Dr. Luo’s main research interest is to innovate novel microfluidic
systems for practical applications. He handles fluids in microscale
(microfluidics), fabricates microscale devices and systems
(microfabrication, MEMS), and integrates biology into devices
(biofabrication, bioMEMS). Dr. Luo found and directs the Integrated
BioMicroFluidics (iBMF) laboratory at CUA, works with biopolymers
extracted from crab/insect shells (chitosan), seaweed algae (alginate)
and collagen, constructs 3D hydrogels and biopolymer/ion exchange
membranes, assembles biomolecules and living cells, and builds optically
active biosensors in microfluidic networks for biological, biomedical,
and tissue engineering as well as energy-harvesting applications.

Biography:

Xiaolong Luo joined the Catholic University of America in Spring 2013
where he currently is an Associate professor in the Department of
Mechanical Engineering. Prior to joining Catholic University, he was a
post-doctoral researcher in the Institute for Bioscience and
Biotechnology Research at the University of Maryland. Dr. Luo has
published more than 40 peer-reviewed papers in leading journals, over 50
conference abstracts, and has filed multiple US patent applications and
disclosure submissions. He is the recipient of the Burns Junior Faculty
Fellowship award from the School of Engineering in 2013, the CAREER
award from National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2016, the Kaman
Excellence in Research Award from the School of Engineering at Catholic
University in 2016, and the Young Faculty Scholar’s Award at Catholic
University in 2017.
