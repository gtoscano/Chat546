Biography:

Matthew Jacobs joined The Catholic University of America (CUA) faculty
in 2019, where he is currently a Clinical Assistant Professor of
Computer Science in the Department of Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science of the School of Engineering. He received his B.S.,
M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from CUA in 2010, 2012, and
2018, respectively. From 2018‐2019, he completed a post‐doctoral
position at the Advanced Cardiovascular Imaging Laboratory within the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institute of Health
and CUA. This research has yielded more than 10 publications in leading
journals and conferences, and one US Patent application.
