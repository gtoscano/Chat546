Biography:

Chris Raub joined the Catholic University of America in 2014 where he is
currently an assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical
Engineering. Prior to joining Catholic University, he had postdoctoral
appointments in Bioengineering at the University of California, San
Diego (F32 postdoctoral fellowship; 2009-2013) and the Department of
Pathology at the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern
California (2013-2014). Dr. Raub has published over 40 papers in leading
journals as well as numerous conferences proceedings papers and a book
chapter.
