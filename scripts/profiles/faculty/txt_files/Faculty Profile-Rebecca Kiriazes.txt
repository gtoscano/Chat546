Biography: Rebecca Kiriazes joined the Catholic University of America in
2022 where she currently is an assistant professor in the Department of
Civil and Environmental Engineering. Rebecca’s research interest focuses
on sustainable and safe transportation systems. Specifically, she works
to model the impacts of new vehicle technologies systems on traveler
behavior and the environment, develops and implements high school
outreach safety engineering programs, and examines the impact of cyclist
infrastructure. In addition to civil engineering research, Rebecca
engages in university STEM education topics with a focus on first-year
engineering and resilience.
